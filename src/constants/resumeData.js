    description: `üåü With 6 years in IT and 5 years in Software full-stack development, I'm proficient in React, Node.js, and Java. I've built scalable solutions, incorporating server-side rendering, pagination, and infinite scroll. üöÄ I implement TDD using JEST and RTL, enhancing code quality with SonarQube. My design systems utilize styled-components, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and Ant Design, with Figma and Zeplin handovers. üé® I developed dashboards, including AirAsia's booking app, and optimize SEO using Lighthouse and Google Analytics. üìà My e-commerce apps achieve high performance with image optimization. üõí In Agile environments, I plan SPRINTs and lead retrospectives. I've introduced micro-frontends with Module Federation and monorepo architectures, developed private libraries, and reduced development time by 50%. üõ†Ô∏è Additionally, I've crafted hybrid architectures with React, Next.js, and Redux, enhancing application performance and UX. üí°`,
